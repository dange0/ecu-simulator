# ECU Simulator

This Python tool simulates some vehicle diagnostic services. It can be used to test OBD-II dongles or tester tools that support the UDS (ISO 14229) and ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) protocols. 

This tool does NOT implement the ISO-TP protocol. It just simulates a couple of OBD and UDS services. The simulation consists in receiving a diagnostic request (e.g., Request DTCs (0x03)), and responding to it according to the protocol specifications. The data of some responses (e.g., VIN) must be defined in the `ecu_config.json` file.

I created this project to learn more about the OBD and UDS protocols. I did my best to understand the specifications, however, if you suspect that something is implemented wrongly, please let me know. Any feedback will be very appreciated.

## Addressing

**OBD:** Functional and physical. See options `obd_broadcast_address` and `obd_ecu_address` in `ecu_config.json`.

**UDS:** Physical. See option `obd_ecu_address` in `ecu_config.json`.

In both cases, only ISO-TP **normal addressing** (only CAN arbitration ID is used) is supported.

## Requirements

* Python3
* [SocketCAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt) Implementation of the CAN protocol. This kernel module is part of Linux. 
* [ISO-TP kernel module](https://github.com/hartkopp/can-isotp) It is NOT part of linux. It needs to be loaded before running the `ecu-simulator`. See `isotp_ko_file_path` in `ecu_config.json`.
* [isotp](https://can-isotp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) The `ecu-simulator` only uses [isotp.socket](https://can-isotp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isotp/socket.html), which is a wrapper for the ISO-TP kernel module.
* [python-can](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html) The `ecu-simulator` uses this library to log CAN messages (see `loggers\logger_can.py`). **Note**: The bus type `socketcan` is used.  

## Usage 

The `ecu-simulator` sets up the CAN interface and loads the ISO-TP linux kernel module (you need to configure `can_interface`, `can_interface_type`, `can_bitrate`, and `isotp_ko_file_path` in `ecu_config.json`). To perform this task, the tool must be started with root privileges:   

```
sudo python3 ecu-simulator.py
```

If you do not want to start the tool with root privileges, you can do the following:

```
# set up CAN hardware interface
sudo sh setup_can.sh <CAN interface e.g., can0> <CAN bitrate e.g., 500000> <can-isotp.ko file pyth e.g., /lib/modules/4.19.75-v7+/kernel/net/can/can-isotp.ko>

# or set up CAN virtual interface 
sudo sh setup_vcan.sh <virtual CAN interface e.g., vcan0> <can-isotp.ko file pyth e.g., /lib/modules/4.19.75-v7+/kernel/net/can/can-isotp.ko>

# and then start the tool without sudo
python3 ecu_simulator.py
``` 

## Logging 

The `ecu-simulator` provides 3 levels of logging: CAN, ISO-TP, and application level. For example, when the VIN is requested, the following is logged:

* In `can_[Timestamp].log`

```
2020-02-05T13:08:39.188 can0 0x7df 0x0209020000000000
2020-02-05T13:08:39.192 can0 0x7e8 0x1014490200544553
2020-02-05T13:08:39.192 can0 0x7e0 0x3000050000000000

```
* In `isotp_[Timestamp].log`

```

2020-02-05T13:08:39.499 can0 0x7e8 0x4902005445535456494e30313233343536373839
```
* In `ecu_simulator.log`

```
2020-02-05T13:08:39.189 - ecu_simulator - INFO - Receiving on OBD address 0x7df from 0x7e8 Request: 0x0902
2020-02-05T13:08:39.190 - ecu_simulator - INFO - Requested OBD SID 0x9: Request vehicle information

```

The log files have a max size of **1.5 M**. A new log file is generated when this size is reached.
 
## Test Environment  

The `ecu-simulator` was tested on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian, Linux Kernel 4.19) with PiCAN and [SBC-CAN01](http://www.anleitung.joy-it.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SBC-CAN01-Anschlussplan.pdf) (see pic below) as CAN-Bus board. 

### OBD-II

The OBD-II services were tested using a real OBD-II scanner.
